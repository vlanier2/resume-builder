# DONE

resume mockup --
    set up html index and files
    made css definitions first
    added html structure with classes
    added css styling

create react app --
    set up app layout. header, footer, editor, viewer. Some Styling for a mockup
    figured out how I wanted to dynamically make components based on type. not sure if this is a great way to do it
    built up a few resume element components
    started todo list and notes

# TO DO

figure out how to lock viewer size to 8.5/11 and overflow auto without breaking layout...

make classes dynamically add to components on creation. right now a lot of them are hard coded.. 
this could be ok for defaults, but probably best to use real defaults. Either way should be set up to 'add a class' 
when an option is selected on the editor

# NOTES

some of my initial styling should have been more 'class based'

seemed simpler to not 'nest' as many html elements in the final resume. I doubt this will have a negative impact on 
machine readability - and will be able to avoid nesting react components.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
